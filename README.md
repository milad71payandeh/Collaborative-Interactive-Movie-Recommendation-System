In this research, we first reviewed past works related to movie recommender systems. Then we developed our proposed method, in which we used the TF-IDF criterion to transform data and the similarity criterion to obtain the common tastes of users with similar tastes.

Also, to evaluate the proposed model, we have used two measures:
1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
2. Mean absolute error (MAE)

The results were slightly improved in comparison with the other 3 models
